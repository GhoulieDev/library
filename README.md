This is a Library App that allows users to add/remove/view information about books and maintains information through refresh and browser close using local storage.

This project was made to practice using objects with the idea of improving code organisation.

Topics learned:
- HTML forms: how to create/style/get information from form submission
- Objects/Constructors/Prototypes
- Object and DOM association via data-attribute
- Local storage

Improvements to practice going forward:
- Function usage/layout
- Better css design and styling
- Debugger usage
- Object usage
